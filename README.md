# US
Umbrella sampling pipeline

# This uses MLX with a collective variable (CV) of the helix Z-COM with a distance calculation to the average position of the phosolipid headgroups

Withing these files, you will find:
- initial windows of MLX. There are 30, all around 0.1nm increments
- mdp file that initializes the run. This determines the force constants etc.
- scripts for analysis. WHAM etc
